# QTC-Trading-Strategies-
Some Trading Strategies I built for Queens Tower Capital - Imperials Investment fund 

Recent strategies include a Kalman filter momentum strategy coupled with an enhanced short-term reversal signal given liquidity constraints. This strategy had a significant Sharpe ratio even out-of-sample

Also built a lightweight back-testing engine to test this alongside other strategies in Python

Notebooks show R&D process as well as both test and train results.
